•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

Driverpass is a subscription-based program that assists students in learning how to drive. The programs client is the students who have no prior knowledge in driving or handling motor vehicles. The system contrives of a user login subscription model, driving appointment live course and DMV regulation feedback.

•	What did you do particularly well?

Learning different UML Models this term I believe creating the charts and diagrams I have done particularly well. But my Favorite was the UML Class and the UML activity model diagrams.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

the one part of the document I will revise is the UML sequence diagram and the UML use case. I do understand the core principle of the flow on how the program flows I would like to create better representation of the terminology of the flow. For the UML use case what I need to improve is becoming more organized and creating diagrams that are less crowded.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Working on the use case diagram makes it clear in identifying and implementing the users needs in the program. By pointing to the relational cases we can have a visual perspective on how the program can affect the users and there educational journey.

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

To get an idea of creating an idea of the designing of a software, as a role of a project manager an interview with the project owner should be the first step. Writing key notes on the functional and nonfunctional relations of the program will help lead to the next step if design UML modeling. A great strategy that would help with the future analysis is creating a UML class chart. Creating the Class chart will help with understanding the idea that will translate well to code.
